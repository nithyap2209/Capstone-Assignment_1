Scammers are hosting dummy websites impersonating internet banking portals & more to collect sensitive financial information.\\nThese dummy Websites are spoofed which appear as a replica of legitimate websites. Let’s see how to spot them and avoid such attacks.\\n1. Don’t click on unknown SMS, email links & malicious pop-ups.\\n2. Look for the Website’s SSL Certificates.\\nAn SSL certificate is a digital certificate that authenticates a website's identity and enables an encrypted connection. Always look for “HTTPS” acronyms in the URL.\\n3. Ensure Website’s Name both in banner & Website’s URL. When in doubt users can search for the organization's website directly using search engines to certify legitimacy.\\n\\nIndia’s Cyberattacks surged 3-fold during the lockdown, that implies our country needs resources and Cybersecurity professional.\\nStart with GUVI-Pro and learn best cybersecurity practices & ethical hacking.

       "  'Description': 'At a high-level, machine learning is simply the study of teaching a computer program or algorithm on how to progressively improve upon a set task that it is given. On the research side of things, machine learning can be viewed through the lens of theoretical and mathematical modeling of how this process works. However, more practically it is the study of how to build applications that exhibit this iterative improvement. There are many ways to frame this idea, but largely there are three major recognized categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\\n\\nWatch the video to know more about Machine Learning and Its Types.\\n\\nVisit www.guvi.in/courses to Learn more.\\n\\nStay on top of your industry by interacting with us on our social channels:\\nFollow us on Instagram: https://instagram.com/guviofficial\\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/guviofficial\\nFollow us on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/guviofficial\\nFollow us on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/guviofficial',\n",

It is analogous to CPAN, the repository for Perl. Some package managers, including pip, use PyPI as the default source for packages and their dependencies. Over 235,000 Python packages can be accessed through PyPI.\\n\\nPyPI primarily hosts Python packages in the form of archives called sdists (source distributions) or precompiled \"wheels.\"\\n\\nPyPI is an index that allows users to search for packages by keywords or by filters against their metadata, such as free software license or compatibility with POSIX.[11] A single entry on PyPI is able to store, aside from just a package and its metadata, previous releases of the package, precompiled wheels (e.g. containing DLLs on Windows), as well as different forms for different operating systems and Python versions.\\n\\nWatch the video by Mr.Arun Prakash, Founder & CTO of GUVI to know more about the Installation of PyPi in python.\\n\\nVisit www.guvi.in/courses to Learn more.\\n\\nFollow us on telegram for more resources and Daily quizzes - http://cutt.ly/guvi-telegram\\n\\nStay on top of your industry by interacting with us on our social channels:\\nFollow us on Instagram: https://instagram.com/guviofficial\\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/guviofficial\\nFollow us on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/guviofficial\\nFollow us on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/guviofficial',\n",

Next, lists are mutable which you can modify after creation.\\n\\nA tuple is though similar to a list, but it’s immutable. Another semantic difference between a list and a tuple is “Tuples are heterogeneous data structures whereas the list is a homogeneous sequence.“.\\n\\nA dictionary is an associative array of key-value pairs. It’s unordered and requires the keys to be hashable.

This network creates the means for transacting, and enables transferring of value and information.\\nCryptocurrencies are the tokens used within these networks to send value and pay for these transactions. Furthermore, you can see them as tool on blockchain, in some cases serving as a resource or utility function. Other times they are used to digitize value of an asset.\\nBlockchains serve as the basis technology, in which cryptocurrencies are a part of the ecosystem. They go hand in hand, and crypto is often necessary to transact on a blockchain. But without the blockchain, we would not have a means for these transactions to be recorded and transferred.\\n\\nA 30 days webinar by GUVi #GUVI_Karo_Na #Blockchain #Cryptocurrency #GUVI \\n\\nStay on top of your industry by interacting with us on our social channels: \\nFollow us on Instagram: https://instagram.com/guviofficial \\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/guviofficial \\nFollow us on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/guviofficial \\nFollow us on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/guviofficial',\n",

This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. \\nThey need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.\\n\\nA 30 days webinar by GUVi #GUVI_Karo_Na #Frontenders #GUVI \\n\\nStay on top of your industry by interacting with us on our social channels: \\nFollow us on Instagram: https://instagram.com/guviofficial \\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/guviofficial \\nFollow us on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/guviofficial \\nFollow us on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/guviofficial',\n",

New tools give freelancers more leverage than ever before, and our culture continues to push us to get big, right now.\\n\\nThe thing is, more effort can’t solve this dilemma for you.
